# Sorcerer's Cave Game

This is a 'game' which loads a data file consisting of different characters, parties, items, artifacts, and tasks.  Each character must have certain items or artifacts present in their party in order to complete tasks, and each item or artifact can only be used by one character at a time.  This emulates multi-threading with shared resources.
